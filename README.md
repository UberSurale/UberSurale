Junior+ Manual QA / Novice Automation QA

I've been working as an English and French teacher for four straight years, and then suddenly, I decided to become an artisan. But not the usual kind! I strongly believe that programming and software testing are forms of art. Being able to actually change the product you're working on — priceless.

I started my journey in IT as a Flutter developer and worked on many projects, but eventually decided to move into a QA position due to its flexibility. Oh boy, I love QA. You don't just write code — you make the product better.

* Know my way around ***UI***: https://dprofile.ru/case/102587/sait-centra-my
* Have strong ***project management*** skills: standups, weekly retrospectives, demos of new features — all on me (and I love it).
* Worked on ***AI projects*** (built a RAG-based customer support system for us).
* Currently learning ***Playwright + TypeScript***.
